# The intension of this script is to let you adjust
# your environment after applying a new theme.

# For instance one might want to reload certain processes
# like windowmanagers and statusbars. 

# $1 in this script contains the output from
# `pre-apply`. By using eval you can pass multiple
# variables and stuff between the scripts.
