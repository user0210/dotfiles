README OneStepBack

==OneStepBack==

OneStepBack is a Gtk 2 and 3 theme with some colors and embossed widgets inspired by the good old NextStep look. I'm old.

It is developed from scratch, is light and minimal, uses only three shades of grays and one color. That was the challenge.

It has been tested on Arch Linux with Gnome-Shell, Gtk+ from 3.16 to 3.24, a good amount of Gtk2 and Gtk3 applications. A lot of widget controls are still missing (but the defaults should be good enough) and it is not tested at all with unity or xfce.

==Version==

Current version is 0.992, released in November 2020.

==Screenshots==

The screenshots show OneStepBack theme and a slightly darker variation. They show also: [Ubo Icons Theme https://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php?content=122078] with personal additions, [Dash to Dock https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/307/dash-to-dock/] and [Dynamic Top Bar https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/885/dynamic-top-bar/] Gnome Shell extensions.

==Known Bugs==

- LibreOffice: black color on black background in some widgets: unfortunatly, nothing I can do. Workaround: please try to put "``export SAL_USE_VCLPLUGIN=kf5``" in your ``~/.xsessionrc`` file  (or ``~/.xprofile``, or ``~/.bashrc``) and restart your X session.

- Firefox, Thunderbird and QT5 applications: arrow buttons shape and colors, color of active menu items: unfortunatly, nothing I can do.
