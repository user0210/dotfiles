*FIRSTMOVE
Your first task is to find a suitable^
site and found your capital city.^
The best city sites are near rivers,^
grasslands, coastal areas, or areas^
near special resources.^

*BUILDCITY
This spot looks like a good site for a^
city. Select 'Found New City' from the^
ORDERS menu or use the 'b' key to found^
a city here.^

*FIRSTPRODUCT
Each of your cities can build additional^
Settlers, military units, or city improve-^
ments to further the growth of your civil-^
ization. Only one item can be in production^
per city. Production orders can be changed^
at any time. Select the item you wish to^
build by clicking the 'CHANGE' button in^
the city information screen which follows.^

*FIRSTCIV
Cities also act as centers for trade and^
the flow of information. Your wise men^
and scientists can collect this information^
to acquire important new abilities and^
skills for your civilization. Use the^
following menu to direct their studies:^

*FIRSTUNIT1
You have just built your first military^
unit. Use the keyboard arrows to move^
this unit and the Orders menu to give^
special commands. Military units allow^
you to explore, expand, attack, and^
defend your civilization. 

*FIRSTUNIT2
Fortify units in your cities to defend^
them against barbarians or enemy armies.^
Settler units can found new cities as well^
as build roads, irrigation, and mines.^
Attack your enemies with Legions, Chariots,^
and Catapults.

*MINING
This area could produce more resources.^
Mining ('m') these hills will add to the^
production capacity of $US.^

*IRRIGATE
This would be a suitable area to build^
irrigation ('i'). More food will help the^
city of $US to grow more rapidly.^

*ROAD
This would be a good place to build a^
road. Your units will be able to move^
faster and more trade will be generated^
in the city of $US.^

*MONARCHY
You have just acquired knowledge of^
MONARCHY. Under a MONARCHY your citizens^
are more productive but the maintenance^
costs of military units are higher. To^
change your government to a MONARCHY,^
you must first have a Revolution!^
(Revolution: see the GAME Menu).^

*LAND
LAND MASS:^
^
- A planet with a normal land mass will favor a mixture of islands and continents.^
- A planet with a small land mass will tend to have more islands, encouraging
isolated and undisturbed civilization development.^
- A planet with a large land mass will tend to have more continents, encouraging
more trade and war between civilizations.^

*TEMPERATURE
TEMPERATURE:^
^
- A planet with TEMPERATE temperatures will favor a mixture of all terrain types.^
- A planet with COOL temperatures will favor the formation of Arctic and
Tundra terrain at the expense of Desert.^
- A planet with WARM temperatures will favor the formation of Desert
terrain at the expense of Tundra and Arctic.^

*CLIMATE
CLIMATE:^
^
- A planet with a NORMAL climate will favor a mixture of all terrain types.^
- A planet with an ARID climate will have more Desert and Plains.^
- A planet with with a WET climate will have more Jungles, Swamps, and Rivers.^

*AGE
AGE:
^
- A younger planet has large areas of similar terrain (forests, mountains, etc.)
- An older planet has smaller, more broken up features.

*HELP1
GENERAL PRINCIPLES: (1)^
^
Defend your cities with at least one^
(preferably two) good defensive units.^
^
Strike a balance between improving your^
existing cities and striking out to found^
new cities.^
^
Don't expand beyond your ability to defend^
yourself; barbarians and hostile armies^
may appear without warning.^

*HELP2
GENERAL PRINCIPLES: (2)^
^
Make peace with your stronger neighbors.^
Isolate and conquer your weaker neighbors.^
^
Think about changing your government to^
Monarchy once your cities reach sizes of^
six or seven.^
^
As your civilization grows don't forget to^
use your Diplomats to learn what your^
opponents are up to. Use Caravans to^
establish trade routes and strengthen^
your economy.^

*DISORDER
A city falls into Civil Disorder when^
the number of unhappy citizens exceeds^
the number of happy citizens. Growth^
and production cease while a city is^
in disorder. Remedies for disorder^
include: turning citizens into enter-^
tainers, moving military units into^
the city, building a Temple, Cathedral,^
or Colosseum, increasing the amount of^
trade used for Luxuries. See pp. 66 in^
the manual for more details.^

*SCHISM
The $THEM are a large and powerful^
civilization. However, rebel factions^ 
threaten to start a civil war. If your^
armies can capture their capital city,^
the shock could split the country in two!^
